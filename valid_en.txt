Then why did they not submit when Our punishment came upon them? But their hearts were hardened, and Satan made things they were doing look attractive to them.
When they had become oblivious of what they were warned, We opened wide the gates of everything to them; yet as they rejoiced at what they were given, We caught them unawares, and they were filled with despair.
Thus were the wicked people rooted out of existence to the last. All praise be to God, the Lord of all the worlds.
Say: "Imagine if God takes away your hearing and sight, and sets a seal on your hearts, what deity other than God will restore them to you?" See how We inflect Our signs: Even then they turn aside.
Say: "Imagine if the punishment of God were to come unawares, or openly, who will perish but the evil - doers?"
We do not send apostles but to give good tidings and to warn. Then those who believe or reform will have neither fear nor regret.
But those who deny Our messages will be seized by nemesis for being disobedient.
Tell them: "I do not say that I possess the treasures of God, or have knowledge of the Unknown, or that I am an angel. I only follow what is sent down to me." And say: "How can a blind man and a man who can see, be alike? Will you not reflect?"
Warn those who fear, through this (Qur 'an), that they will be gathered before their Lord, and they will have none to protect or intercede for them apart from Him. They may haply take heed for themselves.
Do not turn away those who supplicate their Lord morning and evening, seeking His magnificence. You are not accountable for them in the least, nor they for you at all. If you drive them away you will only be unjust.
Thus do We try men through one another so that they may ask: "Are these the ones of all of us who have been favoured by God?" Does God not know who are the grateful?
When those who believe in Our revelations come to you, say to them: "Peace on you." Your Lord has prescribed grace for Himself, so that in case one of you commits evil out of ignorance, then feels repentant and reforms, He may be forgiving and kind.
Thus distinctly do We explain Our signs that the way of sinners may become distinct.
Tell them: "I am forbidden to worship those you invoke apart from God." And say: "I will not follow your wishes. If I do, I shall be lost and not be one of those who follow the right path."
Tell them: "A clear proof has come to me from my Lord, and Him you deny. But what you wish to be hastened is not within my power. The judgement is only God 's. He unfolds the Truth, and is the best of judges."
Say: "If what you wish to be hastened were in my power, all matters between you and me would have been settled; God is cognisant of those who are unjust."
He has the keys of the Unknown. No one but He has knowledge; He knows what is on the land and in the sea. Not a leaf falls without His knowledge, nor a grain in the darkest (recess) of the earth, nor any thing green or seared that is not recorded in the open book (of nature).
It is He indeed who sends you to death at night, and knows what you do in the day, then makes you rise with it again in order that the fixed term of life be fulfilled. Then to Him you will be returned when He will tell you what you did.
He has power over His creatures, and appoints guardians to watch over them. When death comes to one of you, Our messengers take away his soul, and do not falter.
Then they are taken to God, their real lord and master. His indeed is the judgement; and He is swift at reckoning.
Ask: "Who is it who comes to your rescue in the darkness of the desert and the sea, and whom you supplicate humbly and unseen: 'If You deliver us from this, we shall indeed he grateful?'
Say: "God delivers you from this and every calamity. Even then you ascribe compeers (to Him)!"
Say: "He has power to send you retribution from the skies above, or the earth beneath your feet, or confound you with divisions among you, and give one the taste of the vengeance of the other." See, how distinctly We explain Our signs that they may understand.
This (Book) has been called by your people a falsehood though it is the truth. Say: "I am not a warden over you."
A time is fixed for every prophecy; you will come to know in time.
When you see them argue about Our messages, withdraw from their company until they begin to talk of other things. In case the Devil makes you forget, leave the company of these unjust people the moment you remember this.
As for the heedful and devout, they are not accountable for them, but should give advice: They may haply come to fear God.
Leave those alone who have made a sport and frolic of their faith, and have been seduced by the life of this world. Remind them hereby lest a man is doomed for what he has done. He will have none to help him, or intercede for him, other than God; and even if he offer all the ransoms they will not be accepted from him. They are those who will be destroyed by their own acts. There will be scalding water to drink for them and painful punishment, for they had disbelieved.
Say: 'Should we call in place of God one who can neither help nor do us harm, and turn back after having been guided by God, like a man beguiled by the devils who wanders perplexed in the wilderness while his friends call him back to the right path, saying:' Come to us, this way? 'Say: "God' s guidance is (true) guidance, and we have been commanded to submit to the Lord of all the worlds.
Observe (your) devotional obligations and fear (God), for it is He before whom you will be gathered (in the end). "
It is He who created the heavens and the earth with a definite purpose. The day He will say "Be," it will be. His word is the truth, His alone the power on the Day when the blast of the trumpet will be sounded. He knows the hidden and the visible. He is all - prudent and all - knowing.
Remember when Abraham said to Azar, his father: "Why do you take idols for God? I certainly find you and your people in error."
Thus We showed to Abraham the visible and invisible world of the heavens and the earth, that he could be among those who believe.
When the night came with her covering of darkness he saw a star, and (Azar, his father) said: "This is my Lord." But when the star set, (Abraham) said: "I love not those that wane."
When (Azar) saw the moon rise all aglow, he said: "This is my Lord." But even as the moon set, (Abraham) said: "If my Lord had not shown me the way I would surely have gone astray."
When (Azar) saw the sun rise all resplendent, he said: "My Lord is surely this, and the greatest of them all." But the sun also set, and (Abraham) said: "O my people, I am through with those you associate (with God).
I have truly turned my face towards Him who created the heavens and the earth: I have chosen one way and am not an idolater. "
His people argued, and he said: "Do you argue with me about God? He has guided me already, and I fear not what you associate with Him, unless my Lord wills, for held within the knowledge of my Lord is everything. Will you not reflect?
And why should I fear those you associate with Him when you fear not associating others with God for which He has sent down no sanction? Tell me, whose way is the way of peace, if you have the knowledge?
They alone have peace who believe and do not intermix belief with denial, and are guided on the right path. "
This is the argument We gave to Abraham against his people. We exalt whosoever We please in rank by degrees. Your Lord is wise and all - knowing.
And We gave him Isaac and Jacob and guided them, as We had guided Noah before them, and of his descendants, David and Solomon and Job and Joseph and Moses and Aaron. Thus We reward those who are upright and do good.
Zachariah and John We guided, and guided Jesus and Elias who were all among the upright.
We gave guidance to Ishmael, Elisha and Jonah and Lot; And We favoured them over the other people of the world,
As We did some of their fathers and progeny and brethren, and chose them, and showed them the right path.
This is God 's guidance: He gives among His creatures whom He will. If they had associated others with Him, surely vain would have been all they did.
Those were the people to whom We gave the Book and the Law and the Prophethood. But if they reject these things We shall entrust them to a people who will not deny.
Those were the people who were guided by God; so follow their way. Say: "I ask no recompense of you for this. It is but a reminder for all the people of the world."
But they failed to make a just estimation of God when they said: "He did not reveal to any man any thing." Ask them: "Who then revealed the Book that Moses brought, - - a guidance and light for men, - - which you treat as sheafs of paper, which you display, yet conceal a great deal, though through it you were taught things you did not know before, nor even your fathers knew?" Say: "God," and leave them to the sport of engaging in vain discourse.
And this (Qur 'an) is another Book that We have revealed, blessed, affirming the earlier (revelations), so that you may warn the people of (Makkah) the town of towns, and those who live around it. Those who believe in the life to come shall believe in it and be watchful of their moral obligations.
Who is more vile than he who slanders God of falsehood, or says: "Revelation came to me," when no such revelation came to him; or one who claims: "I can reveal the like of what has been sent down by God?" If you could see the evil creatures in the agony of death with the angels thrusting forward their hands (saying): "Yield up your souls: This day you will suffer ignominious punishment for uttering lies about God and rejecting His signs with arrogance."
"You have come before Us all alone," (God will say), "as when you were created first, leaving behind all that We had bestowed on you. We do not see your intercessors with you who, you imagined, had partnership with you. Shattered lie your ties with them now, and gone are the claims you made."
Indeed it is God who splits up the seed and the kernel, and brings forth the living from the dead, the dead from the living. This is God: So whither do you stray?
He ushers in the dawn, and made the night for rest, the sun and moon a computation. Such is the measure appointed by Him, the omnipotent and all - wise.
It is He who made the stars by which you reckon your way through the darkness of the desert and the sea. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who recognise.
It is He who produced you from a single cell, and appointed a place of sojourning, (the womb of the mother), and a place of depositing, (the grave). How clear have We made Our signs for those who understand.
It is He who sends down water from the skies, and brings out of it everything that grows, the green foliage, the grain lying close, the date palm trees with clusters of dates, and the gardens of grapes, and of olives and pomegranates, so similar yet so unlike. Look at the fruits, how they appear on the trees, and they ripen. In all these are signs for those who believe.
Yet they ascribe to jinns a partnership with God, although He created them; and they ascribe to Him sons and daughters, without possessing any knowledge. All praise be to Him. He is much too exalted for things they associate (with Him).
Creator of the heavens and the earth from nothingness, how could He have a son when He has no mate? He created all things, and has knowledge of all things.
This is God, your Lord; there is no god but He, the creator of all things. So pay homage to Him, for He takes care of everything.
No eyes can penetrate Him, but He penetrates all eyes, and He knows all the mysteries, for He is all - knowing.
To you have come signs from your Lord, (and the light of understanding). So any one who sees (and understands) does so for himself, and any one who turns blind shall suffer the consequences alone. (Say:) "I am not a guardian over you (to make you understand)."
Thus in varied ways We explain Our signs so that they may say: "You have been instructed," and that We might make it clear to those who understand.
So follow what is sent down to you by your Lord, for homage is due to no one but God, and turn away from idolaters.
Had He willed they would not have been idolaters. We have not appointed you their guardian, nor are you their pleader.
Do not revile those who invoke others apart from God, lest they begin to revile God out of malice and ignorance. We have made attractive their deeds to every people. They have to go back to their Lord, when He will tell them what they used to do.
They solemnly swear by God: "If a sign comes to us we shall certainly believe in it." Tell them: "The signs are with God." Yet for all you know they will not believe if the signs came to them.
We shall turn their hearts and their eyes, for they did not believe them at the very first, and leave them to wander perplexed in bewilderment.
Even if We send down the angels to them, and the dead should speak to them, and We gather all things before their eyes, they will not believe, unless God should will, for most of them are ignorant.
That is how We have made for each apostle opponents, the satans among men and jinns, who inspire one another with deceitful talk. But if your Lord had willed they would not have done so. Pay no attention to them and to what they fabricate.
Let those who do not believe in the life to come, listen to it and be pleased with it, and let them gain what they may gain.
(Say): "Then should I seek (the source of) law elsewhere than God, when it is He who has revealed this Book to you, which distinctly explains (everything)?" Those to whom We have given the Book know it has been sent by your Lord in truth. So be not a sceptic.
Perfected are the laws of your Lord in truth and justice, and there is no changing His laws. He is all - hearing and all - knowing.
If you follow the majority of people on the earth, they will lead you astray from the path of God, for they follow only conjecture and surmise.
Your Lord surely knows those who have strayed from his path, and knows those who are rightly guided.
Eat only that over which the name of God has been pronounced, if you truly believe in His commands.
And why should you not eat of that over which the name of God has been pronounced, when He has made it distinctly clear what is forbidden, unless you are constrained to do so. Surely many (men) mislead others into following their vain desires through lack of knowledge. Your Lord certainly knows the transgressors.
Discard both the visible and invisible sin. For those who sin will be punished for what they have done.
Do not eat of that over which God 's name has not been pronounced, for that would amount to exceeding the limits of law. Certainly the devils inspire their proteges to dispute with you: If you obey them, you will surely become an idolater.
Can he who was lifeless, to whom We gave life, and gave him a light in whose glow he walks among men, be like him who is used to darkness from which he can never emerge? Thus have been their doings made attractive to unbelievers.
And thus have We placed in every city the greatest of the sinners to contrive and deceive; yet they contrive against no one but themselves even though they do not know.
Every time a sign comes to them they say: "We shall never believe till what God 's apostles had been given comes to us." God knows best where to direct His messages. A degradation will befall the sinners and chastisement from God for deceiving.
Thus God guides whomsoever He please by opening wide his breast to surrender; and Straitens the breasts of those He allows to go astray, (who feel suffocated) as if they were ascending the skies. Thus will God punish those who do not believe.
This is the straight path of your Lord. Distinct have We made Our signs for those who reflect.
For them is an abode of peace with their Lord. He will be their defender as reward for what they did.
On the day He will gather them together, (He will say:) "O you assembly of jinns, you made great use of men." But their proteges among men will say: "O our Lord, we lived a life of mutual gain, but have now reached the term You ordained for us." "Your abode is Hell," He will say, "where you will dwell for ever, unless God please otherwise." Verily your Lord is wise and all - knowing.
Thus do We place some sinners over others as requital for their deeds.
O you assembly of jinns and men, did not apostles come to you from among you, communicating My signs to you, bringing warnings of this your day (of Doom)? "They will answer:" We bear witness to our sins. "They were surely deluded by the life of the world, and bore witness against themselves because they were unbelievers.
And this (so that it may be clear) that your Lord does not destroy towns and cities arbitrarily while the citizens remain unaware.
Every one has his place according to his deeds, for your Lord is not negligent of what you do.
Your Lord is all - sufficient and full of benevolence. He can take you away if He please, and make whom He will succeed you, as He had raised you from the progeny of others.
The promise that was made to you is bound to be fulfilled. It is not in your power to defeat it.
Tell them: "O my people, go on acting on your part, I am acting on mine. You will soon know whose is the guerdon of life to come." The wicked will not succeed.
They allocate a share from God 's own created fields and cattle to God, and they say: "This is God' s" - - or so they think - - "and that, of the compeers of God," so that what belongs to the compeers does not reach God, but that which is God 's may reach the compeers (set up by them). How bad is the judgement that they make!
In the same way have their companions shown many unbelievers the killing of their children as desirable in order to ruin them and falsify their faith. If God had so willed they would never have done so. Leave them to their falsehoods.
They also say: "These cattle and these crops are consecrated. None may eat of them other than those we permit," - - so they assert. "And the use of these cattle is forbidden for carrying burden." They do not pronounce the name of God on certain animals, inventing lies against Him. He will punish them for what they fabricate.
And they say: "Whatever is in the wombs of these cattle is only meant for men and forbidden our women; but in case it should be still - born both could eat it." God will punish them for what they assert. He is all - wise and all - knowing.
They will surely perish who kill their offspring in ignorance foolhardily, and forbid the food that God has given them by fabricating lies against God. Misguided are they surely, and will never come to guidance.
It is He who grew the gardens, trellised and bowered, and palm trees and land sown with corn and many other seeds, and olives and pomegranates, alike and yet unlike. So eat of their fruit when they are in fruit, and give on the day of harvesting His due, and do not be extravagant, for God does not love those who are prodigal.
He has created beasts of burden and cattle for slaughter. So eat of what God has given you for food, and do not walk in the footsteps of Satan who is surely your declared enemy.
There are eight pairs, two of the species of sheep and two of goats. Ask them which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs? Produce the sanction if you are truthful.
And there are two of camels and two of oxen. Ask them: "Which has He forbidden, the two males or the two females, or what the females carry in their wombs?" Were you present at the time God issued this command? "Who then could be more wicked than he who fabricates a lie and ascribes it to God to mislead men, without any knowledge? God does not guide the miscreants.
You tell them: "In all the commands revealed to me I find nothing which men have been forbidden to eat except carrion and running blood and flesh of the swine for it is unclean, or meat consecrated in the name of some other than God, which is profane. But if one is constrained to eat of these without craving or reverting to it, then surely your Lord is forgiving and kind."
We made unlawful for the Jews all animals with claws or nails, and the fat of the oxen and sheep, except that on their backs or their intestines, or which remains attached to their bones. This was the punishment for their insubordination; and what We say is true.
If they call you a liar, tell them infinite is the mercy of your Lord; but His vengeance will not be turned back from the sinners.
But the idolaters say: "If God had so willed we would not have associated (others with Him), nor would have our fathers, nor would we have forbidden any thing." So had others denied before them, and had to taste Our punishment in the end. Ask them: "Have you any knowledge? Then display it. You follow nothing but conjecture, and are nothing but liars."
Say: "To God belongs the consummate argument. Had He willed He would surely have guided all of you aright."
Tell them: "Bring your witnesses to testify that God has forbidden this (and this)." Then even if they testify, you should not testify with them; and do not follow the wishes of those who deny Our signs and believe not in the Hereafter, and make others the equal of their Lord.
Tell them: "Come, I will read out what your Lord has made binding on you: That you make none the equal of God, and be good to your parents, and do not abandon your children out of poverty, for We give you food and We shall provide for them; and avoid what is shameful, whether open or hidden, and do not take a life which God has forbidden, unless for some just cause. These things has God enjoined on you. Haply you may understand.
Do not spend the belongings of the orphans but for their betterment, until they come of age; and give in full measure, and weigh justly on the balance. God does not burden a soul beyond capacity. When you say a thing, let it be just, even though the matter relate to a relative of yours, and fulfil a promise made to God. These are the things that He has enjoined that you may take heed.
(He has further commanded:) 'This is My straight path, so walk along it, and do not follow other ways, lest you should turn away from the right one.' All this has He commanded. You may perhaps take heed for yourselves. "
To that end We gave the Book to Moses, a perfect law, distinctly explaining all things, and a guidance and grace, so that they should believe in the meeting with their Lord.
Blessed is this Book We have revealed; so follow it and preserve yourself from evil that you may qualify for grace,
Lest you say: "The Book that was sent before was meant only for two groups; we were not aware of their teachings;"
Or that: "Had the Book been sent down to us we would surely have been guided better than they." So you have now received from your Lord a clear proof and a guidance and grace. Then who is more wicked than he who denies the signs of God and turns away from them? We shall punish those severely who turn away: A requital indeed for having turned aside.
What are the people waiting for? For the angels to come down, or your Lord to appear, or some signs from your Lord? The day when certain signs appear from your Lord, the embracing of faith shall not be of any avail to one who did not come to belief at first, or who did not perform good deeds by virtue of his faith. Tell them: "Wait on, we are waiting too (for the good and evil to become distinct)."
As for those who have created schisms in their order, and formed different sects, you have no concern with them. Their affair is with God. He will tell them the truth of what they were doing.
He who does a good deed will receive ten times its worth; and he who does evil will be requited to an equal degree; and no one will be wronged.
Tell them: "My Lord has directed me to a path that is straight, a supreme law, the creed of Abraham the upright who was not an idolater."
Tell them: "My service and sacrifice, my life and my death, are all of them for God, the creator and Lord of all the worlds.
No equal has He, I am commanded (to declare), and that I am the first to submit. "
Say: "Shall I search for another lord apart from God when He is the only Lord of all and everything?" Each soul earns (what it earns) for itself, and no man shall bear another 's burden. You have to go back to your Lord in the end when He will tell you about the things you disputed.
It is He who made you trustees on the earth, and exalted some in rank over others in order to try you by what He has given you. Indeed your Lord 's retribution is swift, yet He is forgiving and kind.
Alif Lam Mim Sad.
This Book has been sent down to you; so do not hesitate to warn (the unbelievers) through it, and remind the faithful.
Follow what has been revealed to you by your Lord, and do not follow any other lord apart from Him. Yet little do you care to remember.
Many a habitation have We laid low before: Our retribution came upon them in the night or in the midst of siesta at noon.
And when Our punishment overtook them they had nothing to say except crying out: "We have indeed been sinners."
(On the Day of Reckoning) We shall question the people to whom We had sent Our apostles, (if they followed their teachings), and will question the apostles.
We shall recount (their deeds) to them with knowledge, for We were never absent (and saw all they did).
And the weighing will be just on that Day. Then those whose (deeds) are heavier in the balance will find fulfilment,
And those whose (deeds) are lighter in the scale shall perish for violating Our signs.
We settled you on the earth, and provided means of livelihood for you in it; but little are the thanks you give.
Verily We created you and gave you form and shape, and ordered the angels to bow before Adam in homage; and they all bowed but Iblis who was not among those who bowed.
"What prevented you" (said God), "from bowing (before Adam) at My bidding?" "I am better than him," said he. "You created me from fire, and him from clay."
So God said: "Descend. You have no right to be insolent here. Go, and away; you are one of the damned."
"Grant me respite," said he, "till the raising of the dead."
And God said: "You have the respite."
"Since You led me into error," said Iblis, "I shall lie in wait for them along Your straight path.
And I shall come upon them from the front and behind, right and left; and You will not find among them many who would give thanks. "
"Begone," said (God), "contemptible and rejected! As for those who follow you, I shall fill up Hell with all of you.
And you, O Adam, and your spouse, live in the Garden and eat your fill wheresoever you like, but do not approach this tree, or you will become iniquitous. "
But Satan suggested (evil) to them, in order to reveal their hidden parts of which they were not aware (till then), and said: "Your Lord has forbidden you (to go near) this tree that you may not become angels or immortal."
Then he said to them on oath: "I am your sincere friend;"
And led them (to the tree) by deceit. When they tasted (the fruit) of the tree their disgrace became exposed to them; and they patched the leaves of the Garden to hide it. And the Lord said to them: "Did I not forbid you this tree? And I told you that Satan was your open enemy.
They said: "O our Lord, we have wronged ourselves. If You do not forgive us and have mercy upon us, we shall certainly be lost."
"Go," said God, "one the antagonist of the other, and live on the earth for a time ordained, and fend for yourselves.
You will live there, and there will you die, "He said," and be raised from there (On the Day of Doom). "
O sons of Adam, We have revealed to you a dress that would both hide your nakedness and be an adornment, but the raiment of piety is best. This is one of the tokens of God: You may haply reflect.
O sons of Adam, let not Satan beguile you as he did your parents out of Eden, and made them disrobe to expose their disgrace to them. For he and his host can see you from where you cannot see them. We have made the devils the friends of those who do not believe,
Who say when they commit shameful acts: "Our ancestors used to do so, and God has enjoined us to do the same." Say to them: "God never enjoins a conduct that is shameful. You impute such lies to God as you do not know."
Tell them: "My Lord has enjoined piety, devotion in all acts of worship, and calling upon Him with exclusive obedience. For you will be reverted back to what you were (when) created first."
A Section (among them) were guided, a section were bound to go astray, (for) instead of God they took the devils as their friends; yet they think they are on the right path.
O sons of Adam, attire yourselves at every time of worship; eat and drink, but do not be wasteful, for God does not like the prodigals.
Ask them: "Who forbids you attire that God has given to His creatures, and the good things that He has provided?" Tell them: "They are (meant) for believers in the world, and will be theirs on the Day of Judgement." That is how We explain Our signs to those who know.
Tell them: "My Lord has forbidden repugnant acts, whether open or disguised, sin and unjust oppression, associating others with God, of which He has sent down no authority, and saying things of God of which you have no knowledge."
A term is fixed for every people; and when their appointed time is come there will neither be a moment 's delay nor haste.
O sons of Adam, when apostles come to you from among you, who convey My messages, then those who take heed and amend will have neither fear nor regret.
But those who deny Our signs and disdain them, shall belong to Hell, where they will abide for ever.
Who could be more wicked than he who imputes lies to God or denies His revelations? Such as these will receive what is declared in the Book, and when Our angels come to draw out their souls and ask: "Where are they you worshipped other than God?" They will answer: "They have left us and fled;" and bear witness against themselves for being infidels.
"Enter then the Fire," will God say, "with the past generations of jinns and men." On entering each batch will condemn the other; and when all of them shall have entered one after the other, the last to come will say of those who had come before them: "O our Lord, they are the ones who led us astray; so give them double chastisement in the Fire." He will answer: "For all it will be double; but this you do not know."
Then the former will say to the latter: "You have no privilege over us. So taste the punishment for what you had done."
Verily for those who deny Our signs and turn away in haughtiness from them, the gates of heaven shall not be opened, nor will they enter Paradise, not till the camel passes through the needle 's eye. That is how We requite the transgressors:
For them is a flooring of Hell and a covering (of fire). That is how We requite the iniquitous.
As for those who believe and do good, We never burden a soul beyond capacity. They are men of Paradise where they will abide for ever.
Whatever the rancour they may have in their hearts We shall (cleanse and) remove. Streams of running water shall ripple at their feet, and they will say: "We are grateful to God for guiding us here. Never would we have been guided if God had not shown us the way. The apostles of our Lord had indeed brought the truth." And the cry shall resound: "This is Paradise you have inherited as meed for your deeds."
And the inmates of Paradise will call to the residents of Hell: "We have found that the promise made to us by our Lord was true. Have you also found the promise of your Lord to be true?" They will answer: "Yes (it is so)." Then a crier will call from among them: "The curse of God be on the vile,
"Who obstruct those who follow the path of God and try to make it oblique, who do not believe in the life to come."
There will be a veil between them, and on the wall will be the men (of al - A 'raf) who will recognise everyone by their distinguishing marks, and will call to the inmates of Paradise: "Peace on you," without having entered it themselves though hoping to do so.
When their eyes fall on the inmates of Hell they will say: "O Lord, do not place us in the crowd of the vile."
Recognising them by their marks the men of al - A 'raf will call (to the inmates of Hell): "Of what use was your amassing (of wealth) of which you were proud?"
(Then pointing to the inmates of Paradise, they will say): "Are they not those of whom you had sworn and said: 'God will not have mercy on them?' (And yet they have been told,) 'Enter Paradise where you will have no fear or regret.'"
Those in Hell will call to the inmates of Paradise: "Pour a little water over us, or give us a little of what God has given you." They will answer: "God has verily forbidden these to those who denied the truth.
"Who made a sport and frolic of their faith and were lured by the life of the world." As they had forgotten the meeting of this Day so shall We neglect them today for having rejected Our signs.
Indeed We had brought to them a Book distinct, replete with knowledge, and guidance and grace for men who believe.
Are they waiting for the exposition of what it speaks of? The day that (Reality) is unravelled, the people who had lost sight of it will say: "The apostles of our Lord had indeed brought the truth. Do we have any one to intercede for us? If only we could go back to the world, we would act otherwise." Indeed they have caused themselves harm, and the lies they concocted did not help.
Surely your Lord is God who created the heavens and the earth in six spans of time, then assumed all power. He covers up the day with night which comes chasing it fast; and the sun and moon and the stars are subject to His command. It is His to create and enjoin. Blessed be God, the Lord of all the worlds.
Pray to your Lord in humility and unseen. He does not love the iniquitous.
And do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed; and pray to Him in awe and expectation. The blessing of God is at hand for those who do good.
Indeed it is He who sends the winds as harbingers of auspicious news announcing His beneficence, bringing heavy clouds which We drive towards a region lying dead, and send down rain, and raise all kinds of fruits. So shall We raise the dead that you may think and reflect.
The soil that is good produces (rich) crops by the will of its Lord, and that which is had yields only what is poor. So do We explain Our signs in different ways to people who give thanks.
We sent Noah to his people, and he said: "O people worship God; you have no other god but He; for I fear the retribution of the great Day may fall on you."
The elders of his people replied: "We see clearly that you have gone astray."
"I have not gone astray, O my people," he said, "but have been sent by my Lord, the creator of all the worlds.
I bring to you the messages of my Lord, and give you sincere advice, for I know from God what you do not know.
Do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your Lord through a man who is one of you, and warns you to take heed for yourselves and fear God? You might be treated with mercy. "
But they called him a liar, and We saved him and those with him in the Ark, and drowned the others who rejected Our signs, for they were a people purblind.
And We sent Hud, their brother, to the people of 'Ad. He said: "O you people, worship God, for you have no other god but He. Will you not take heed for yourselves?"
The chiefs of his people who were infidels replied: "We find you full of folly, and a liar to boot."
"I am not a fool, O people," he answered, "but have been sent by the Lord of all the worlds.
I bring to you the messages of my Lord. I am your sincere friend.
Do you wonder that a warning has come to you from your Lord through a man who is one of you and warns you? Remember, He made you leaders after the people of Noah, and gave you a greater increase in your stature. So think of the favours of God; you may haply be blessed. "
They answered: "Have you come to say to us that we should worship only one God, abandoning those our ancestors had worshipped? If so, bring on us what you threaten us with, if what you say is true."
He replied: "You have already been beset with punishment and the wrath of God. Why dispute with me about names invented by you and your ancestors for which no sanction was sent down? So wait (for what is to come), I am waiting with you."
Then We saved him and those on his side by Our grace, and destroyed to the very last those who rejected Our signs and denied the truth.
We sent to Thamud their brother Saleh. "O you people," said he, "worship God, for you have no other god but He. Clear proof has come to you already from your Lord, and this she - camel of God is the token for you. Leave her free to graze upon God 's earth, and do not molest her lest a grievous punishment should befall you.
Remember, how you were made leaders after the people of 'Ad, and were settled on the land so that you could construct on the plains palaces, and carve dwellings out of mountains. So think of the favours of God, and do not act with corruption in the land. "
The chiefs among the people who were arrogant towards the weaker ones among them who believed, asked: "Do you really know that Saleh has been sent by his Lord?" They said: "Indeed we believe in the message he has brought."
Those who were arrogant answered: "We do not believe in what you believe."
Then they hamstrung the she - camel and rebelled against the command of their Lord, and said: "Bring, O Saleh, on us the affliction you promise, if you are one of the sent ones."
Then they were seized by an earthquake, and lay overturned on the ground in their homes in the morning.
Saleh turned away from them and said: "O my people, I conveyed to you the message of my Lord and warned you; but you do not like those who wish you well."
And We sent Lot, who said to his people: "Why do you commit this lecherous act which none in the world has committed before?
In preference to women you satisfy your lust with men. Indeed you are a people who are guilty of excess. "
His people made no answer, and only said: "Drive them out of the city. They profess to be pure."
But We saved him and his family, except for his wife who was one of those who stayed behind.
And We rained down on them a shower (of Stones). So witness the end of sinners!
Remember, We sent to Midian their brother Shu 'aib. "O you people," he said, "worship God, for you have no other god but He. Clear proof has come to you from your Lord; so give in full measure and full weight; do not keep back from people what is theirs, and do not corrupt the land after it has been reformed. This is best for you if you believe.
Do not lie in ambush to intimidate and divert from the path of God those who believe in Him, nor seek obliquity in it. Remember the day when you were few and He increased your numbers. So consider the fate of those who were evil.
If some of you believe what has been sent through me, and some of you do not, have patience until God decide between us, for He is the best of all judges. "
The arrogant leaders of the people replied: "We shall drive you away from our land, O Shu 'aib, and those who are with you, unless you come back to your faith." But he remarked: "Even if we are disgusted with it?
We shall only be guilty of blaspheming God if we accept your way after the people of Noah, and gave you a greater increase in your stature. So think of the favours of God; you may haply be blessed. "
The chiefs among his people who did not believe said (to them): "If you follow Shu 'aib and his way you will surely be ruined."
Then they were seized by an earthquake, and lay overturned on the ground in their homes in the morning.
They who called Shu 'aib a liar (disappeared) as though they had never existed; and those who called Shu' aib a liar were the ones who were ruined!
So Shu 'aib turned away from them and said: "O people, I conveyed to you the message of my Lord, and warned you. (But you paid no heed). How can I grieve for a people who do not believe?"
There is not a region to which We sent a prophet and did not inflict upon its people adversity and hardship so that they may submit.
But when We changed hardship to ease, and they rose and prospered, (they forgot Our favours) and said: "Our ancestors had also known suffering and joy." So We caught them unawares.
But if the people of these regions had believed and feared God, We would surely have showered on them blessings of the heavens and the earth; but they only denied, and We punished them for their deeds.
Are the people of the region so secure that they lie asleep unaware as Our punishment overtakes them?
Or, are the people of the towns so unafraid that (even when) Our retribution comes upon them in the hours of the morning they remain engrossed in sport and play?
Can they remain secure against the plan of God? Only they feel secure against the plan of God who are certain of being ruined.
Do not the people who inherited the earth from the (earlier) inhabitants perceive that We could afflict them too for their sins if We pleased, and put seals on their hearts that they may not hear (the voice of truth)?
These were the (earlier) habitations whose accounts We have given to you. Their apostles came with clear proofs, but they did not believe what they once denied. That is how God seals the hearts of those who do not believe.
We did not find many of them faithful to their promises, and found many of them disobedient.
So We sent Moses with miracles after (these apostles) to the Pharaoh and his nobles, but they behaved with them high - handedly. See then the end of the authors of evil.
Moses said: "O Pharaoh, I have been sent by the Lord of all the worlds;
"I am duty bound to speak nothing of God but the truth I have brought from your Lord a clear sign; so let the people of Israel depart with me."
He said: "If you have brought a sign then display it, if what you say is true."
At this Moses threw down his staff, and lo, it became a live serpent.
And he drew forth his hand, and behold, it looked white to those who beheld it.
The nobles of Pharaoh said: "He surely is a clever magician.
"He wishes to drive you away from the land. So what do you advise?"
They said: "Put him and his brother off (awhile) and send out heralds to the cities
"To bring all the wise magicians to you."
The magicians came to the Pharaoh and said: "Is there reward for us if we succeed?"
"Yes," said he, "you will be among the honoured."
So they said: "O Moses, you may cast your spell first, or we shall cast ours."
"You cast it first," answered Moses. When they cast their spell, they bewitched the eyes of the people and petrified them by conjuring up a great charm.
We said to Moses: "Throw down your staff;" and it swallowed up their conjurations in no time.
Thus the truth was upheld, and the falsehood that they practised was exposed.
Thus there and then they were vanquished and overthrown, humiliated.
The sorcerers fell to the ground in homage,
And said: "We have come to believe in the Lord of all the worlds,
"The Lord of Moses and Aaron."
But Pharaoh said: "You have come to accept belief in Him without my permission! This surely is a plot you have hatched to expel the people from the land. You will soon come to know.
"I will have your hands and feet on alternate sides cut off, and have you all crucified."
They answered: "We have (in any case) to go back to our Lord.
"The only reason you have to hate us is that we believed in the signs of our Lord as they came to us. O our Lord, give us sufficient endurance that we may die submitting (to You)."
And the leaders of Pharaoh 's people said to him: "Would you allow Moses and his people to create disorder in the land and discard you and your gods?" He replied: "We shall now slay their sons and spare their women, and subdue them."
Said Moses to his people: "Invoke the help of God and be firm. The earth belongs to God: He can make whom He wills among His creatures inherit it. The future is theirs who take heed for themselves."
They said: "We were oppressed before you came, and have been since you have come to us." He answered: "It may well be that soon God may destroy your enemy and make you inherit the land, and then see how you behave."
We afflicted the people of Pharaoh with famine and dearth of everything that they might take heed.
Yet when good came their way they said: "It is our due;" but when misfortune befell them they put the omen down to Moses and those who were with him. But surely the omen was with God, yet most of them did not understand.
They said: "Whatsoever the sign you have brought to deceive us, we shall not believe in you."
So We let loose on them floods and locusts, and vermin, frogs and blood - - how many different signs. But they still remained arrogant, for they were a people full of sin.
Yet when punishment overtook them, they said: "O Moses, invoke your Lord for us as you have been enjoined. If the torment is removed, we shall certainly believe in you and let the people of Israel go with you."
But no sooner was the punishment withdrawn for a time to enable them to make good their promise than they broke it.
So We took vengeance on them, and drowned them in the sea for rejecting Our signs and not heeding them.
We then made the people who were weak (and oppressed) successors of the land to the East and the West which We had blessed. Thus the fair promise of your Lord to the children of Israel was fulfilled, for they were patient in adversity; and whatsoever the Pharaoh and his people had fashioned, and the structures they had raised, were destroyed.
When We brought the children of Israel across the sea, and they came to a people who were devoted to their idols, they said: "O Moses, make us also a god like theirs." "You are ignorant," he replied.
"These people and their ways will surely be destroyed, for false is what they practise.
"Do you want me to seek for you," he said, "a god other than God, when He has exalted you over all the nations of the world?
"Remember (the day) when He saved you from the people of Pharaoh who oppressed and afflicted you, and slew your sons and spared your women. In this was a great trial from your Lord."
We made an appointment of thirty nights with Moses (On Mount Sinai) to which We added ten more; so the term set by the Lord was completed in forty nights. Moses said to Aaron, his brother: "Deputise for me among my people. Dispose rightly, and do not follow the way of the authors of evil."
When Moses arrived at the appointed time and his Lord spoke to him, he said: "O Lord, reveal Yourself to me that I may behold You." "You cannot behold Me," He said. "But look at the mountain: If it remains firm in its place you may then behold Me." But when his Lord appeared on the mountain in His effulgence, it crumbled to a heap of dust, and Moses fell unconscious. When he came to, he said: "All glory to You. I turn to You in repentance, and I am the first to believe."
Said (the Lord): "O Moses, I raised you above all men by sending My messages and speaking to you; so receive what I give you, and be grateful."
And We wrote down on tablets admonitions and clear explanations of all things for Moses, and ordered him: "Hold fast to them, and command your people to observe the best in them. I will show you the abode of the wicked.
I will turn those away from My signs who behave unjustly with arrogance in the land so that even though they see all the signs they will not believe in them; and if they see the path of rectitude, will not take it to be a way; and if they see the way of error take it to be the (right) path. This is so for they have called Our messages lies, and have been heedless of them. "
Vain are the acts of those who deny Our signs and the meeting in the Hereafter. Can they ever be rewarded for anything but what they did?
In the absence of Moses his people prepared the image of a calf from their ornaments, which gave out the mooing of a cow. Yet they did not see it could neither speak to them nor guide them to the right path. Even then they took it (for a deity) and did wrong.
Then they were filled with remorse and saw that they had erred and said: "If our Lord does not forgive us we will surely be lost."
When Moses returned to his people, indignant and grieved, he said: "How wickedly you behaved in my absence. Why must you hasten the decree of your Lord?" And he cast aside the tablets, and pulled his brother by the hair. "O son of my mother," said (Aaron), "these people took advantage of my weakness and almost killed me. Do not let my enemies rejoice at my plight, and do not put me down among transgressors."
(Moses) said: "O Lord, forgive me and my brother, and admit us to Your grace, for You are the most compassionate of all."
Surely those who have taken the calf (as a god) will suffer the anger of their Lord, and disgrace in the world. That is how We requite those who fabricate lies.
Yet those who do wrong, then repent and believe, are forgiven, for your Lord is forgiving and kind.
When his anger subsided Moses picked up the tablets. Inscribed on them was guidance and grace for those who fear their Lord.
Moses chose seventy of his people for the appointment (on Mount Sinai). When they arrived they were seized by a tremor. (Moses) said: "O Lord, if You had so pleased You could have annihilated them and me before this. Will You destroy us for something the foolish among us have done? This is but a trial from You whereby You will lead whom You will astray and guide whom You please. You are our saviour, so forgive us and have mercy on us, for You are the best of forgivers.
Enjoin for us good in the world, and good in the world to come. We turn to You alone. "And the Lord said:" I punish only those whom I will, but My mercy enfolds everything. I shall enjoin it for those who take heed for themselves, who pay the zakat and believe in My signs,
Who follow the messenger, the gentile Prophet, described in the Torah and the Gospel, who bids things noble and forbids things vile, makes lawful what is clean, and prohibits what is foul, who relieves them of their burdens, and the yoke that lies upon them. Those who believe and honour and help him, and follow the light sent with him, are those who will attain their goal. "
Say: "O men, I am verily the apostle of God to you all. His whose kingdom extends over the heavens and the earth. There is no god but He, the giver of life and death. So believe in God and the messenger, the gentile Prophet, sent by Him, who believes in God and His messages. Obey him; you may haply be guided aright."
Among the people of Moses is a section that shows the way to the truth, and deals justly in accordance with it.
We divided them into twelve (different) tribes. When his people asked for water, We said to Moses: "Strike the rock with your staff;" and behold, twelve springs of water gushed forth, so that each of the tribes had a place of its own to drink; and We made the clouds spread shade over them and sent for them manna and quails (and said): "Eat of the good things We have provided for you." But (by disobeying) they did not harm Us, they harmed themselves.
And when it was said to them: "Live in this land and eat of its produce wheresoever you like, and ask for remission of your sins, but pass through the gates with submission (and not pride), We shall forgive your trespasses, and give to those who are righteous abundance,"
The wicked among them changed and perverted the word We had spoken to a word unpronounced; so We sent from heaven retribution on them for all their wickedness.
Enquire of them about the town situated by the sea where, when they did not keep the Sabbath, the fish came up to the surface of the water for them; but on days other than the Sabbath the fish did not come. We tried them in this way, for they were disobedient.
When a Section of them said: "Why do you admonish a people whom God is about to destroy or to punish severely?" They replied: "To clear ourselves of blame before your Lord, and that they may fear God.
But when they forgot to remember the warning, We saved those who prohibited evil, but inflicted on the wicked a dreadful punishment - - requital for their disobedience.
When they persisted in doing what they had been forbidden, We said to them: "Become (like) apes despised."
And your Lord declared He would send men against them who would inflict dreadful suffering on them till the Day of Doom, for your Lord is swift in retribution, though He is certainly forgiving and kind.
We dispersed them in groups over the earth, some righteous, some otherwise; and We tried them with good things and bad, that they may haply turn back.
Then after them a new generation inherited the Book. They took to the things of this base world, and said: "We shall (surely) be forgiven this." Yet they will accept similar things if they came their way again. Had they not been covenanted in the Book to say nothing in the name of God but the truth? And they have read this in it. The abode of the life to come is better for those who fear God. Can they not comprehend?
As for those who adhere to the Book and are firm in devotion, We shall certainly not let the wages of those who are upright to go waste.
The day We shook the mountain above them like an awning, and they feared it would fall over them, (We said): "Hold fast to what We have given you, and bear in mind what is (said) therein so that you may take heed."
When your Lord brings forth from their loins the offspring of the children of Adam, He makes them witnesses over themselves, (and asks): "Am I not your Lord?" 'Indeed,' they reply. 'We bear witness,' - - lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: "We were not aware of this;"
Or, lest they should say: "It were our fathers who had ascribed compeers to God; we are only their offspring. Will You destroy us for the deeds of those who dealt in vanities?"
That is how We explain Our signs distinctly so that they may come back (to the right path).
Relate to them the plight of the man whom We gave Our signs, but he passed them by, so that Satan came after him, and he went astray.
We wished to exalt him, but he loved baseness and followed his lust. His likeness is that of a dog who hangs out his tongue if you drive him away, and still hangs it out if you leave him alone. Such is the case of the people who deny Our signs. Narrate this history to them; they may haply reflect.
Evil is the case of those who deny Our signs and wrong themselves.
He alone is guided whom God shows the way; and whom He leads astray is surely lost.
Many of the jinns and human beings have We destined for Hell, who possess hearts but do not feel, have eyes but do not see, have ears but do not hear, like cattle, even worse than them. They are people unconcerned.
All the names of God are beautiful, so call Him by them; and leave those alone who act profanely towards His names: They will be retributed for their deeds.
Yet there are among those We have created people who lead (others) to the truth, and act justly in its light
We shall punish those who deny Our revelations slowly in a way that they will not know.
I will just give them respite. My plan is certainly invincible.
Have they not bethought themselves their companion is not mad? He is only a plain admonisher.
Have they not contemplated the kingdom of the heavens and the earth and everything created by God, (to educe) that perhaps their own term is drawing to a close? In what lore after this would they then believe?
Whosoever God allows to go astray has none to show him the way, for He leaves them to wander perplexed in their wickedness.
They ask you about the Hour: "When is its determined time?" Say: "Only my Lord has the knowledge. No one can reveal it except He. Oppressive will it be for the heavens and the earth. When it comes, it will come unawares." They ask you about it as if you were in the know. You tell them: "Only God has the knowledge." But most people do not know.
Tell them: "I am not master of my own gain or loss but as God may please. If I had the knowledge of the Unknown I would have enjoyed abundance of the good, and no evil would have touched me. I am only a bearer of warnings and bringer of happy news for those who believe."
It is He who created you from a single cell, and from it created its mate, that you may live as companions. When the man covered the woman she conceived a light burden and carried it about. And when she was heavy (with child) they prayed together to their Lord: "If You bestow a healthy son on us we shall truly be grateful."
But when they were given a healthy son, they started ascribing to other powers a share in what God had bestowed on them. But God is above what they ascribe to Him.
Do they associate those with Him who cannot create a thing, and are themselves created,
Who can neither help them, nor help themselves?
If you call them to guidance they will not follow you. It is all the same if you call them or hold your tongue.
Those whom you invoke besides God are created beings like you. So call on them and let them answer your call, if what you say is true.
Do they have feet to walk on, or hands to hold with, or eyes to see and ears to hear with? Say to them: "Call your compeers, and work out a plot against me, and do not give me time.
My saviour is God who has revealed this Book; and He protects those who are upright;
While those you beseech apart from Him cannot help you or even help themselves.
When you call upon them for guidance, they do not hear. When you think they are looking at you, (in fact) they cannot see. "
Cultivate tolerance, enjoin justice, and avoid the fools.
If you are instigated by the Devil to evil seek refuge in God, for God hears all and knows everything.
Verily those who fear God think of Him when assailed by the instigations of Satan, and lo! they begin to understand,
Even though their (devilish) brothers would like them to continue in error, and would not desist.
And when you do not bring a (Qur 'anic) verse to them, they say: "Why don' t you make one up?" Say: "I follow only what my Lord reveals to me." These (revelations) are an evident proof from your Lord, and a guidance and grace for those who believe.
When the Qur 'an is recited listen to it in silence. You may perhaps be blessed.
Meditate on your Lord inwardly with humility and trepidation, reciting His Book softly, morning and evening, and be not negligent.
Verily those who are in the presence of your Lord are never too proud to worship and celebrate His praises, and bow in homage to Him '.
THEY ASK YOU of (benefits accruing as) spoils of war. Tell them: "The benefits belong to God and His Messenger." So fulfil your duty to God and keep peace among yourselves. Obey God and the Prophet, If you really believe.
Only they are true believers whose hearts fill up with awe when the name of God is mentioned; and their faith is further strengthened when His messages are read out to them; and those who place their trust in their Lord,
Who are firm in devotion, and spend of what We have given them,
Are true believers. There are for them (high) ranks with their Lord, and pardon and noble provision.
As your Lord sent you from your home (to fight) for the true cause, a section of the faithful were averse,
Who argued with you about the matter even after it had become quite clear, as if they were being pushed into (the arms of) death as they waited.
Though God promised that one of two columns (would fall to you), you desired the one that was not armed. But God wished to confirm the truth by His words, and wipe the unbelievers out to the last,
So that Truth may be affirmed and falsehood negated, even though the sinners be averse.
Remember when you prayed to your Lord for help, He heard you and said: "I shall send a thousand angels following behind you for your aid."
He gave you the good news only to reassure your hearts, for victory comes from God alone, and certainly God is all - mighty and all - wise.
A blanketing sleep came over you as a (measure of) security from Him, and He sent down rain from the skies to cleanse you, and to remove the plague of Satan, and to strengthen your hearts and steady your steps.
And the Lord said to the angels: "I am with you; go and strengthen the faithful. I shall fill the hearts of infidels with terror. So smite them on their necks and every joint, (and incapacitate them),"
For they had opposed God and His Apostle; but whosoever opposes God and his Apostle (should know) that God is severe in retribution.
For you is this (punishment) to taste, for the infidels the torment of Hell.
O believers, when you meet unbelievers on the field of battle, do not turn your backs to them.
For any one who turns his back on that day, except to manoeuvre or rally to his side, will bring the wrath of God on himself, and have Hell as abode; and what an evil destination!
It was not you who killed them, but God did so. You did not throw what you threw, (sand into the eyes of the enemy at Badr), but God, to bring out the best in the faithful by doing them a favour of His own. God is all - hearing and all - knowing.
That was that, but remember God will make the plots of the unbelievers contemptible.
You had asked for a judgement, so the judgement has come to you (In the form of victory for the faithful). So, if you desist it will be better for you. If you come back to it, We shall do the same, and your forces, however large, will not be of the least avail, for God is with those who believe.
O believers, obey God and His Messenger, and do not turn away from him when you hear (him speak);
And do not be like those who say: "We have heard," but do not hear.
The worst of creatures in the eyes of God are those who are deaf and dumb and devoid of sense.
If God had seen any good in them He would surely have made them hear. Now even if He makes them hear they will turn away (in obduracy).
O believers, respond to the call of God and His Prophet when he calls you to what will give you life (and preservation). Remember that God intervenes between man and his heart, and that you will be gathered before Him.
Beware of sedition, which does not affect the oppressors alone among you, and know that the punishment of God is severe.
Remember, when you were few and powerless in the land, afraid of despoliation at the hands of men. But then God sheltered and helped you to strength, and provided for you good things that you may perhaps be grateful.
O you who believe, do not be faithless to God and His Apostle, nor violate your trusts knowingly.
Know that your worldly possessions and your children are just a temptation, and that God has greater rewards with Him.
O believers, if you follow the path shown by God, He will give you a standard (of right and wrong), and overlook your sins, and forgive you. God is abounding in benevolence.
Remember, when the infidels contrived to make you a prisoner or to murder or expel you, they plotted, but God also planned; and God 's plan is the best.
When Our messages were read out to them, they said: "We have heard. We could certainly compose (writings) like them if we choose. They are but only tales of long ago."
They had also said: "If this be the truth from you, O God, then rain down on us stones from the skies, or inflict a grievous punishment upon us."
But God would not choose to punish them while you are in their midst, nor afflict them when they are seeking forgiveness.
But what is there so special they have that God should not punish them when they obstruct people from the Holy Mosque, though they are not its (appointed) guardians? Its guardians could be only those who are pious and devout. But most of them do not know.
Their worship in the House of God has been no more than whistling and clapping. So they have to taste the punishment for disbelief.
Those who disbelieve spend their possessions on turning men away from God. They will go on spending and rue it in the end, and will be subdued. But those who remain disbelievers shall be gathered into Hell
That God may separate the bad from the good, and link the wicked together and cast them into Hell. These are verily the people who will lose.
You tell the unbelievers in case they desist whatever has happened will be forgiven them. If they persist, they should remember the fate of those who have gone before them.
So, fight them till all opposition ends, and obedience is wholly God 's. If they desist then verily God sees all they do.
But if they are obstinate, know that God is your helper and protector: How excellent a helper, and how excellent a protector is He!
Know that one - fifth of what you acquire as booty (of war) is for God and His Apostle, and for relatives and orphans, the poor and wayfarers, if you truly believe in God and what We revealed to Our votary on the day of victory over the infidels when the two armies clashed (at Badr). For God has the power to do any thing.
(That day) when you were at one end of the valley, (the unbelievers) at the other, and the caravan below you (on the lowland by the coast), you would surely have declined to fight if (the Makkans) had offered you battle. (But the battle did take place) that God may end the matter which had been accomplished, so that he who had to die may perish after a clear demonstration, and he who had to live may survive in the light of positive proof, for God hears all and knows everything.
God showed (the Makkans) to be few in your dream, for if He had shown them to be many you would surely have lost courage and disagreed about the (wisdom) of the battle. But God spared you this, for He surely knows what is in the hearts of men.
When you faced them He made (the enemy) seem few to you in numbers, and made you appear fewer in their eyes, (it was) so that God could accomplish what had been decreed; for all things rest with God.
O believers, when you meet an army, stand firm, and think of God a great deal that you may be blessed with success.
Obey God and His Apostle, and do not disagree among yourselves or you will be unmanned and lose courage. Persevere, for God is with those who endure.
Do not be like those who went out of their homes full of their own importance, ostentatiously, trying to hinder others from the way of God. But God encompasses all they do.
Satan made their deeds look alluring to them, and said: "None will prevail over you this day, for I shall be near at hand." Yet when the two armies appeared face to face, he turned back and fled, saying: "I am not with you, for I can see what you cannot perceive. I fear God, for His punishment is severe."
The hypocrites, and those who had doubts in their hearts, said: "Their faith has misled them." But whoever places his trust in God will find God mighty and wise.
If you could only see the infidels as the angels draw away their souls and strike their faces and their backs, (saying): "Taste the torment of burning
For what you have brought upon yourselves. "God is surely not unjust to His creatures, (they are unjust to themselves).
Their case is like that of Pharaoh 's people, and of those before them, who denied the revelations of God, and were punished for their sins by God, and God is all powerful and Severe His punishment.
God does not withdraw a favour bestowed upon a people unless they change themselves, for God hears all and knows everything.
This was the case with the people of Pharaoh and those before them, who rejected the signs of their Lord and were destroyed for their sins, and We drowned the people of Pharaoh as they were oppressors.
Verily the worst of creatures in the sight of God are those who deny (the truth), and will not believe.
As for those with whom you have made a treaty and who abrogate it every time, and do not fear God,
If you meet them in battle, inflict on them such a defeat as would be a lesson for those who come after them, and that they may be warned.
If you apprehend treachery from a people (with whom you have a treaty), retaliate by breaking off (relations) with them, for God does not like those who are treacherous.
The infidels should not think that they can bypass (the law of God). Surely they cannot get away.
Prepare against them whatever arms and cavalry you can muster, that you may strike terror in (the hearts of) the enemies of God and your own, and others besides them not known to you, but known to God. Whatever you spend in the way of God will be paid back to you in full, and no wrong will be done to you.
But if they are inclined to peace, make peace with them, and have trust in God, for He hears all and knows everything.
If they try to cheat you, God is surely sufficient for you. It is He who has strengthened you with His help and with believers
Whose hearts He cemented with love. You could never have united their hearts even if you had spent whatever (wealth) is in the earth; but God united them with love, for He is all - mighty and all - wise.
God is sufficient for you, O Prophet, and the faithful who follow you.
O Prophet, urge the faithful to fight. If there are twenty among you with determination they will vanquish two hundred; and if there are a hundred then they will vanquish a thousand unbelievers, for they are people devoid of understanding.
God has lightened your burden as He knows you are weak: So, if there are a hundred men of firm determination among you, they will vanquish two hundred; and if there are a thousand of you they will vanquish two thousand by the will of God, for God is with those who are determined.
No apostle should take captives until he has battled and subdued the country. You desire the vanities of this world, but God wills (for you the reward) of the world to come; and God is all - mighty and all - wise.
Had this not been decreed by God in advance, you would have suffered a grievous punishment for what you took (as booty).
But now use such of the spoils as are lawful and good, and fear God, for God is forgiving and kind.
O Prophet, tell the captives you have taken: "If God finds some good in your hearts, He will reward you with something better than was taken away from you, and forgive your sins, for God is forgiving and kind."
If they try to deceive you, remember they have deceived God before. So He gave you mastery over them, for God is all - knowing and all - wise.
Those who accepted the faith and set out of their homes, and fought in the way of God wealth and soul, and those who gave them shelter and helped them, are friends of one another. You are not responsible for protecting those who embraced the faith but did not leave their homes, until they do so. In ease they ask for your help in the name of faith, you are duty bound to help them, except against a people with whom you have a treaty; for God sees all that you do.
Those who are infidels aid one another. Unless you do the same there will be discord in the land and anarchy.
Those who accepted the faith and abandoned their homes, and struggled in the cause of God, and those who gave them shelter and helped them, are veritably true believers. For them is forgiveness and noble sustenance.
Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought by your side, are your brothers; yet those who are related by blood are closer to one another according to the decree of God. Verily God knows everything.
IMMUNITY is granted those idolaters by God and his Apostle with whom you have a treaty.
(They can) move about for four months freely in the land, but should know they cannot escape (the law of) God, and that God can put the unbelievers to shame.
A general proclamation is (made) this day of the Greater Pilgrimage on the part of God and His Apostle, that God is not bound (by any contract) to idolaters, nor is His Apostle. It is, therefore, better for you to repent. If you do not, remember that you cannot elude (the grip of) God. So announce to those who deny the truth the news of painful punishment,
Except those idolaters with whom you have a treaty, who have not failed you in the least, nor helped anyone against you. Fulfil your obligations to them during the term (of the treaty). God loves those who take heed for themselves.
But when these months, prohibited (for fighting), are over, slay the idolaters wheresoever you find them, and take them captive or besiege them, and lie in wait for them at every likely place. But if they repent and fulfil their devotional obligations and pay the zakat, then let them go their way, for God is forgiving and kind.
If an idolater seeks protection, then give him asylum that he may hear the word of God. Then escort him to a place of safety, for they are people who do not know.
How could there be a treaty between idolaters and God and His Apostle, except those you covenanted by the Sacred Mosque? Therefore as long as they are honest with you be correct with them, for God loves those who are godly.
How (can they be trusted)? If they prevail against you they will neither observe pacts nor good faith with you. They flatter you with their tongues, but their hearts are averse to you, for most of them are iniquitous.
They barter away the words of God for a petty price, and obstruct (others) from His path. How evil indeed are the things they do!
They have no regard for kinship or treaties with believers, for they are transgressors.
But if they repent and are firm in devotion and pay the zakat, then they are your brothers in faith. We explain Our commands distinctly for those who understand.
If they break their pledge after giving their word and revile your faith, fight these specimens of faithlessness, for surely their oaths have no sanctity: They may haply desist.
Will you not fight those who broke their pledge and plotted to banish the Apostle, and who were the first to attack you? Are you afraid of them? If you are believers you should fear God more.
Fight them so that God may punish them at your hands, and put them to shame, and help you against them, and heal the wounds of the hearts of believers,
And remove the anger from their breasts; for God turns to whosoever desires. God is all - knowing and all - wise.
Do you think you will get away before God knows who among you fought and did not take anyone but God, His Apostle and the faithful, as their friends? God is cognisant of all that you do.
The idolaters have no right to visit the mosques of God while bearing testimony to their disbelief. Meaningless will be their acts, and in Hell they will bide for ever,
Only those who believe in God and the Last Day, who fulfil their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and fear no one but God, can visit the mosques of God. They may hope to be among the guided.
Do you think that giving a drink of water to the pilgrims and going on a visit to the Sacred Mosque, is the same as believing in God and the Last Day, and striving in the cause of God? In the eyes of God it is not the same; and God does not show the unrighteous the way.
Those who accepted the faith and left their homes and fought in the way of God, wealth and soul, have a greater reward with God, and will be successful.
Their Lord announces to them news of His mercy, acceptance, and gardens of lasting bliss
Which they will enjoy for ever. Indeed God has greater rewards with Him.
O you who believe, do not hold your fathers and brothers as friends if they hold disbelief more dear than faith; and those of you who do so are iniquitous.
You tell them: "If your fathers and sons, your brothers and wives and families and wealth, or the business you fear may fail, and the mansions that you love, are dearer to you than God, His Apostle, and struggling in His cause, then wait until God 's command arrives, for God does not show transgressors the way."
Indeed God has helped you on many occasions, even during the battle of Hunain, when you were elated with joy at your numbers which did not prove of the least avail, so that the earth and its vast expanse became too narrow for you, and you turned back and retreated.
Then God sent down a sense of tranquility on His Apostle and the faithful; and sent down troops invisible to punish the infidels. This is the recompense of those who do not believe.
Yet God may turn (even) after this to whomsoever He please, for God is compassionate and kind.
O believers, the idolaters are unclean. So they should not approach the Holy Mosque after this year. In case you fear indigence (from the stoppage of business with them), then God will enrich you of His bounty if He will, for God is all - knowing and all - wise.
Fight those people of the Book who do not believe in God and the Last Day, who do not prohibit what God and His Apostle have forbidden, nor accept divine law, until all of them pay protective tax in submission.
The Jews say: "Ezra is the son of God;" the Christians say: "Christ is the son of God." That is what they say with their tongues following assertions made by unbelievers before them. May they be damned by God: How perverse are they!
They consider their rabbis and monks and the Christ, son of Mary, to be gods apart from God, even though they had been enjoined to worship only one God, for there is no god but He. Too holy is He for what they ascribe to Him!
They wish to extinguish the light of God by uttering blasphemies; but God will not have it so, for He wills to perfect His light, however the unbelievers be averse.
It is He who sent His Messenger with guidance and the true faith in order to make it superior to other systems of belief, even though the idolaters may not like it.
O believers, many rabbis and priests devour the possessions of others wrongfully, and keep men away from the path of God. To those who accumulate gold and silver, and do not spend in the way of God, announce the news of painful punishment.
On the day We shall heat up (their gold) on the fire of Hell and brand their foreheads, sides and backs (and say to them): "It is this you stored up for yourselves; so now taste of what you had stored!"
The number of months with God is twelve in accordance with God 's law since the day He created the heavens and the earth. Of these four are holy. This is the straight reckoning. So do not exceed yourselves during them; but fight the idolaters to the end as they fight you in like manner; and remember, God is with those Who preserve themselves from evil and do the right.
Intercalating a month is adding to unbelief. The unbelievers are misguided by this, for they take the same month to be sacred one year and sacrilegious the next, thus making the number of months sanctified by God accord with theirs in order to make what God has forbidden, lawful. Attractive seem to them their evil deeds; but God does not show the unbelievers the way.
What has happened to you, O believers, that when you are asked to set out in the cause of God your feet begin to drag? Do you find the life of the world so pleasing that you forget the life to come? Yet the profit of the life of this world is but meagre as compared to the life to come.
Unless you go out (to strive), God will inflict grievous punishment on you, and bring other people in your place, and you will not be able to harm Him in the least, for God has the power over all things.
If you do not help (the Prophet, remember) God had helped him when the infidels had forced him to leave (and he was) one of two. When both of them were in the cave, he said to his companion: "Do not grieve, for God is with us." Then God sent divine peace on him, and invisible armies for his help, and made the unbelievers' purpose abject. Most exalted is God 's word, for God is all - mighty and all - wise.
O believers, go out in the cause of God, (whether) light or heavy, and strive in the service of God, wealth and soul. This is better for you if you understand.
(O Prophet), had the gain been close at hand, and easy the journey, they would surely have followed you; but hard was the journey and long the going. Even then they swear by God (and say): "If we had the strength we would surely have gone out with you." They are only ruining themselves, for God is aware they lie.
May God forgive you. Why did you allow them (to stay behind) without ascertaining who spoke the truth and who were liars?
Those who believe in God and the Last Day, do not ask your leave to be excused from fighting wealth and soul (in the cause of God), for God knows the pious and devout.
Only they ask (for leave) who do not believe in God and the Last Day, whose hearts are full of doubt; and doubting they waver (between gain and loss).
If they had intended to go out (to fight) they would surely have made preparations. But God did not like their setting forth, and they were held back and told: "Stay at home with those who stay behind."
Had they gone out with you, they would only have been a hindrance and let loose confusion among you to create discord; for there are some in your midst who spy for them. But God knows who are the wicked.
They had tried to create disorder before and intrigued against you, but truth came out in the end and God 's will prevailed, even though they did not like it.
And (many a one) there is among them who says: "Allow me (to stay back at home), and put me not on trial." Surely they have put themselves on trial already, and Hell will enclose the unbelievers from all sides.
If good comes your way they are vexed, but if calamity befalls you, they say: "We had taken precautions in advance;" and pleased, turn away.
Tell them: "Nothing can befall us except what God decrees. Our protector is He, and in God should the faithful place their trust."
Say: "Are you waiting for anything else but one of two good things for us, (victory or martyrdom)? Yet what we are waiting for you is the punishment of God, direct or through us. So keep waiting; we are waiting with you."
Tell them: "You may spend (in the way of God), whether willingly or with reluctance, it will not be accepted from you, for you are reprobates."
Nothing prevents the acceptance of what they spend except that they do not believe in God and His Apostle, and come to worship but languidly and spend only grudgingly.
Do not marvel at their wealth and children. God intends to punish them through these in the world; and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief.
They swear by God they are with you, though in fact they are not. They are only a frightened lot.
If they find a place of shelter or a cave or hole to hide, they will turn to it.
There are some among them who blame you (of partiality) in distributing the offerings made in the name of God. In case they receive some of these they are pleased, if not, they are incensed.
They should rather have been pleased with what God and His Prophet had given them, and said: "God is sufficient for us; He will give us of His largesse as will His Apostle. We supplicate no one but God."
Charities are meant for the indigent and needy, and those who collect and distribute them, and those whom you wish to win over, and for redeeming slaves (and captives) and those who are burdened with debt, and in the cause of God, and the wayfarers: So does God ordain. God is all - knowing and all - wise.
There are some among them who talk ill of the Prophet by saying: "He listens to everyone." Tell them: "He listens for your good, and trusts in God and trusts the faithful, and he is a blessing for those who believe. For those who offend the Apostle of God there is painful punishment."
They swear by God to please you; but if they are believers it would have been worthier to have pleased God and His Apostle.
Have they not realised that anyone who opposes God and His Prophet, will abide in Hell for ever? And that is the worst disgrace.
The hypocrites fear lest a Surah is revealed concerning them, exposing what is in their hearts. Say to them: "Mock as much as you like; God will surely expose what you dread."
But if you ask them, they will say: "We were only gossiping and jesting." You ask them: "Were you jesting with God, His revelations and His messengers?"
Do not make excuses: You turned unbelievers after having come to faith. If We pardon a section of you (for being frivolous), We shall punish the other for being guilty (of deliberate sin).
The hypocrites (are the same) whether men or women, the one of them being of the other. They encourage what is bad and dissuade from the good, and tighten their purses (when it comes to spending in the way of God). Of God they are oblivious; so He is oblivious of them. The hypocrites are indeed transgressors.
God has reserved for hypocrites, whether men or women, and for unbelievers, the fire of Hell, where they will abide for ever. This is sufficient for them: They have God 's condemnation and lasting torment,
Like those before you who were greater in strength, had more wealth and children than you, who enjoyed their lot in this world, as you have enjoyed your share like them. You indulge in idle talk, as they had indulged in vain discourse. Yet nothing of what they did remains in this world or will in the next, and they are the losers.
Has not the account of those before them come to them, - - of the people of Noah and 'Ad and Thamud, of Abraham and Midian, and all the habitations that were destroyed? Their apostles had come to them with clear proofs; and God did not surely wrong them, they wronged themselves.
Those who believe, men and women, befriend one another, and enjoin what is right and prohibit what is wrong. They observe their devotional obligations, pay the zakat, and obey God and His Apostle. God will be merciful to them, for God is all - mighty and all - wise.
God has promised men and women who believe gardens with streams of running water where they will abide for ever, and beautiful mansions in the Garden of Eden, and the blessings of God above all. That will be happiness supreme.
Strive, O Prophet, against the unbelievers and the hypocrites, and deal with them firmly. Their final abode is Hell: And what a wretched destination!
They swear by God: "We never said this." But they surely said words disbelieving the truth, and they turned unbelievers after having come to faith, and designed what they could not accomplish. They did it only out of vengeance for God and His Apostle had enriched them by their grace. So, if they repent it is better for them. If they turn away then God would afflict them with painful punishment in this world and the next; and none will they have on the face of the earth to protect or help them.
Some of them made a covenant with God: "If You give us in Your bounty we shall give alms and be upright."
But when He gave them of His bounty they became greedy, and then turned away.
As a consequence of breaking their promise made to God, and telling lies, he filled their hearts with hypocrisy which will last till the day they come before Him.
Have they not realised that God knows their secrets and their confidential talk, and that God has the knowledge of unknown things?
They who defame those of the believers who give alms willingly, and deride those who have nothing besides what they earn by their labour (to give in charity), will be derided by God, and will suffer painful punishment.
Whether you plead forgiveness for them or not, God will not forgive them, even though you plead seventy times, for they disbelieved in God and His Apostle; and God does not show transgressors the way.
Those who were left behind rejoiced that they stayed at home against the wishes of God 's Apostle, being averse to fighting in the way of God with their wealth and lives, and said: "Do not go in this heat." Tell them: "The heat of Hell is far more intense." If only they had cared to instruct themselves!
So let them laugh a little, for weep they will, more as retribution for what they have done.
If you come back to them by (the grace of) God, and they seek your permission to go (to fight), you should tell them: "You will never go out nor fight the enemy with me any more. You preferred to stay back on the first occasion, so stay at home with those who stay behind."
Do not invoke blessings on any of them who die, nor stand to pray at their graves, for they disbelieved in God and His Prophet, and died transgressors.
And let not their wealth and children astonish you. God wishes to punish them through these in the world, and their souls will depart in a state of disbelief.
Whenever a Surah is revealed (which says): "Believe in God and fight along with His Prophet," the well - to - do among them ask for leave to stay at home, and say: "Leave us with those who are left behind."
They prefer to be with women who (are allowed to) stay at home during war, and their hearts are sealed; so they fail to understand.
But the Prophet and those who have embraced the faith with him, and have fought wealth and soul (in the way of God), are blessed and will be successful.
God has provision for them of gardens with Streams of running water, where they will abide for ever. This will be the supreme triumph.
Some Arabs of the desert came with ready excuses, asking for leave to stay behind. But those who had lied to God and His Prophet stayed at home doing nothing. So the punishment for those who disbelieve among them will be painful.
No blame will attach to the old and the sick, or those without means to spend on good acts, if they stay behind provided they are sincere to God and His Apostle; There is no way to blame those who are doers of good, for God is forgiving and kind.
Nor will they be blamed who came to you for transport, to whom you said: "I cannot find any means of conveyance for you," and they went away in tears, grieving that they lacked the means to spend (on carriage).
Blame will lie on those who are rich yet ask your leave to stay behind. They prefer to stay with women who stay at home, and God seals their hearts; so they do not understand.
When you come back they will offer excuses to you. Tell them: "Make no excuses; we do not believe you. God has informed us about you; and God and His Apostle shall watch your conduct. Then you will be brought to Him who knows what is hidden and what is manifest. He will tell you of what you did."
They will beg you in the name of God, on your return, to forgive them; but you keep away from them: They are scum; their abode is Hell: Requital for what they had done.
They will plead on oath that you accept them. Even if you accept them, remember God does not accept people who are disobedient.
